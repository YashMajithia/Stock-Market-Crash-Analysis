# Stock-Market-Crash-Analysis

## 📉 Market Crash Analysis
This project explores the use of time series analysis to predict market crashes and visualize financial data trends, using Python and popular data science libraries. 
It was inspired by recent market volatility, such as the downturn following President Trump's announcement of a 10% tariff on all U.S. imports in March 2025.

## 📌 Overview
Market crashes often appear sudden, but patterns in historical data can reveal early warning signals. 
This project investigates:
- 📊 Trends preceding historical crashes
- 🧠 Time series modeling techniques
- 📈 Visual indicators of volatility and market sentiment

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- Time series analysis (rolling statistics, moving averages)

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Detected patterns like sudden drops in moving averages, spikes in volatility, and shifting trends before crashes.
- Highlighted how policy changes (like tariffs) can act as triggers for abrupt market movements.
- Emphasized the importance and limitations of predictive analytics in financial forecasting.

## 🚀 Getting Started
